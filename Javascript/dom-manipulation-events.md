# DOM Manipulation and Events (TOP Notes)

Stands for Document Object Model

Follows the parent/child rule for nesting into each other.

Each branch that is on the same level as each other are seen as siblings.

# DOM Methods

Things you can do with DOM manipulation.

- Query Selectors
Returns references based on what you want it to find. Gives this information as a "nodelist", not an array, however it can be changed to one with other commands.
Can refernce certain parents, their childs and siblings, like looking for a specific relative in a family tree.

- Element Creation
Can create a new element and add some parameters to it as well, it doesn't add it to the current DOM, it just creates it in the memory to reference later. You can do this to try out things without committing them to the page.

- Append Elements + Delete Elements
As it says on the tin.

- Altering Elements
You can use a reference to change the properties within an element.
